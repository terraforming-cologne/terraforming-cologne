  <h1>Food and Drinks</h1>

  <p>
    There will be a beverage sale on-site with non-alcoholic drinks. Please handle the bottles carefully to avoid
    breakage and ensure that no games come into contact with drinks.

  <p>
    There will be no in-house food available on-site. However, there are plenty of food places and supermarkets nearby,
    especially on the street "Deutzer Freiheit". Of course, you're welcome to bring your own food. If needed, please
    remember to bring your own cutlery, as we cannot provide it on-site.
