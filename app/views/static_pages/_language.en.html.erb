<h2 class="font-bold">Tournament Language</h2>

<p>
  The tournament organizers speak both German and English, ensuring flexibility for all participants. We strive to
  provide as many English-language games as possible and use them during the tournament, as there will also be
  international guests attending. Therefore, it’s likely that communication during games will be in English.

<p>
  Are you unsure about communicating in English? No problem! There is usually someone at the table who can translate
  your questions if needed, or we’ll find another solution together. A language barrier should never be a reason for
  you not to participate – we’re excited to have you join us!
