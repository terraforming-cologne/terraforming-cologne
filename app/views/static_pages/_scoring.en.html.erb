  <h1>Tournament Mode</h1>

  <p>
    We will play using a Swiss system. This means that in the first round, you will play against random opponents, and
    in subsequent rounds, you will be matched with players who have similar standings.

    <h2>Scoring System</h2>
    <p>
      After each round, you will earn points based on your placement in the game.
    </p>
    <ul class='list-inside list-disc'>
      <li>1st place: 5 points</li>
      <li>2nd place: 3 points</li>
      <li>3rd place: 2 points</li>
      <li>4th place: 1 point</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      At tables with only 3 players, no fourth place is awarded.

    <h2>Tie-Breakers in Games</h2>
    <p>
      In the case of a tie in victory points, the first tie-breaker, as usual, is the amount of MegaCredits. If there
      is still a tie, the production of resources will be considered in the order of MegaCredits, Steel, Titanium,
      Plants, Energy, and Heat. In the extremely unlikely event that a tie persists, the affected players will play a
      round of Rock, Paper, Scissors.

    <h2>Tie-Breakers in the Overall Rankings</h2>
    <p>
      The first tie-breaker in the overall rankings is the sum of the tournament points of all players you have played
      against. If a tie still exists, the average number of victory points per generation will be used. In the
      extremely unlikely event that a tie still remains, the affected players will play a round of Rock, Paper,
      Scissors.
