<h2 class="font-bold">Tournament Mode</h2>

<p>
  We will play using a Swiss system. This means that in the first round, you will play against random opponents, and in
  subsequent rounds, you will be matched with players who have similar standings.
</p>

<br>
<b>Scoring System</b>
<p>
  After each round, you will earn points based on your placement in the game.
</p>
<ul class='list-inside list-disc'>
  <li>1st place: 5 points</li>
  <li>2nd place: 3 points</li>
  <li>3rd place: 2 points</li>
  <li>4th place: 1 point</li>
</ul>
<p>
  At tables with only 3 players, no fourth place is awarded.
</p>

<br>
<b>Tie-Breakers in Games</b>
<p>
  In the case of a tie in victory points, the first tie-breaker, as usual, is the amount of MegaCredits. If there is
  still a tie, the production of resources will be considered in the order of MegaCredits, Steel, Titanium, Plants,
  Energy, and Heat. In the extremely unlikely event that a tie persists, the affected players will play a round of
  Rock, Paper, Scissors.
</p>

<br>
<b>Tie-Breakers in the Overall Rankings</b>
<p>
  The first tie-breaker in the overall rankings is the sum of the tournament points of all players you have played
  against. If a tie still exists, the average number of victory points per generation will be used. In the extremely
  unlikely event that a tie still remains, the affected players will play a round of Rock, Paper, Scissors.
