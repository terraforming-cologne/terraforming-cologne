  <h1>Tournament Rules and Structure</h1>

  <h2>Required Experience Level</h2>

  <p>
    The tournament is organized for players who are already familiar with the
    game and its rules. It is not intended for beginners. This helps us keep our
    greatest enemy in check: time.
  </p>

  <p>
    We will be playing with both the English and German editions of the game.
  </p>

  <br>

  <h2>Number of players per table</h2>

  <p>
    It is our goal to play with four players in each game. If this is not
    possible due to the total number of players, we will fill with three player
    games.
  </p>

  <br>

  <h2>Number of Rounds and Expansions Used</h2>

  <p>
    The tournament will consist of three rounds. Each round will be played on a
    different game board (Tharsis, Hellas, Elysium), provided there are enough
    Hellas & Elysium expansions available. If not, multiple rounds may be played
    on the Tharsis board.
  </p>

  <p>
    We will play using the "Corporate Era" rules and the Prelude expansion (not
    Prelude 2). In total, the game includes 215 project cards, 35 Prelude cards,
    and 17 corporation cards.
  </p>

  <br>

  <h2>Special Tournament Rules</h2>

  <p>
    We will use both the "Corporate Era" rules and the draft variant. However,
    the draft variant will only be used during the research phase. Your initial
    ten starting cards will not be drafted.
  </p>

  <p>
    Additionally, you will select from three corporations instead of the usual
    two.
  </p>

  <br>

  <h2>Round Duration</h2>

  <p>
    Each round will last a maximum of 2.5 hours. Does that sound short? It is.
    However, past tournaments have shown that this time is sufficient even for
    less experienced players.
  </p>

  <p>
    If the time limit is reached, the following rules apply: 15 minutes before
    the 2.5-hour mark, a signal will be given by the tournament organizers. At
    that point, the current generation will be completed. Five minutes before
    the end of the 2.5 hours, a second signal will be given. At this point, all
    players will take one final turn in the current generation, ensuring
    everyone has had an equal number of turns in that generation. The game will
    then conclude with a final production phase and greenery placement. If
    oxygen has not yet reached 14%, it can still be increased during the final
    greenery placement, and you can earn additional Terraform Rating points.
