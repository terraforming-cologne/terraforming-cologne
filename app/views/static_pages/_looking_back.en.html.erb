      <%= time_tag(Date.new(2025, 4, 5)) %>, 85 players participated in the first edition of the German Open! After three rounds, Kyriakos Avgoustis was
      crowned champion with placing first in every single game. It was a day full of good chats, a few security fleets,
      and lots of fun. We hope to see you at the next tournament. Any news concerning the next German Open will be
      published here in the future!
