  <h1>Distinction from FryxGames</h1>

  <p>
    There have been allegations in various online forums against a member of
    FryxGames regarding transphobia. The Facebook posts referenced in these
    allegations date back to 2021 and have since been deleted. In response to
    our inquiry, FryxGames referred to the vision outlined on their website.
  </p>

  <br>

  <p>
    Important: These allegations are four years old, the Facebook posts no
    longer exist, and according to their own vision, FryxGames is committed to a
    gaming table where everyone has a place.
  </p>

  <br>

  <p>
    Nevertheless, we find it important to explicitly distance ourselves from any
    form of discriminatory behavior and to make it clear that everyone is
    welcome at this event, especially LGBTQ+ individuals!
  </p>

  <br>

  <p>
    Handling these allegations against a FryxGames employee was not an easy
    decision for us. In the end, we decided to go ahead with the tournament
    because we see no discriminatory content in the game itself and believe that
    the event provides an opportunity to promote diversity and inclusion.
  </p>

  <br>

  <p>
    The tournament is not sponsored by FryxGames and is organized by the
    community, for the community. Additionally, all proceeds from the tournament
    will be donated to a local organization supporting LGBTQ+ causes. We are
    currently in the process of selecting a suitable organization and will
    announce our choice here as soon as the decision is made.
  </p>

    If you have any further questions or comments about this topic, please feel
    free to reach out to us. We have had extensive discussions within our
    organizing team and are happy to share our thoughts with you.
